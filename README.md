This Ansible role is for managing (creating, editing, deleting) Linux users.
Management includes also the ssh keys keys distribution.

**Note:** this role is using local facts on each server to store user names listed  
in `user_management`. Once you will remove the user from `user_management`  
list, the user and the home directory will be deleted from the server. The users  
not listed in the list, will remain untouched.

#### This role can:
- create users
- delete users
- adding/removing users from the groups
- managing ssh keys
